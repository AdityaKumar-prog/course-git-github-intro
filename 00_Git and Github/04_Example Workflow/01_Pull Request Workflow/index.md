### Git Pull
 Pulling repositories is used for when someone you are working with makes changes to the repo and allows you to update to their changes to be working on the same branch.

```
 git pull 'name of branch'
```

### Cloning a Repository
* `git clone 'url of repository found in github'`
* `git remote add origin 'github url'`
* `git push -u origin master`
* `git push origin 'branchname'`
