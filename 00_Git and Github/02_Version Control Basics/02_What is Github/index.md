### Gitting All Over The World

Github is an online hosting and collaboration service that can be used with the version control system `git`.

Last year Microsoft bought Github for $7.5 Billion!!

Github was created in 2008 by Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett and Tom Preston-Werner.

Github is free to use as long your projects are open-source and visible to anyone. If you want private repositories for yourself or a team you need to sign up for a paid account.

Why use it:

* Sharing projects with others (Collaboration and Code Reviews)
* Backup your projects
* Online portfolio for developers
* Push projects to production
