### Goals of class

* Define Version control
* Grow understanding of how to use github
* Create a github repository and connect it to your local machine

### What is Version Control?

Version control can be slightly difficult to understand at first, but is nothing to get caught up on.

Version control, also known as, `revision control` or `source control` is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large websites, and other collections of information!

Changes to documents are usually labeled with a "revision" which can be a level or number ie. L1, L2, L3... or R1, R2, R3... and a timestamp.


### Other Version Control Systems
* Word processors and Spreadsheets
* Collaborative Web Docs (Google Docs)
* Wikipedias Page History, etc

### Why is it important?

Imagine you are working on a large project and each time you save, your work is continuously overwritten and it is impossible to go back to a previous checkpoint of the work that you have done in the past. This is where version control comes in handy.

Version control allows you to track your changes over time and go back to checkpoints. This means that every time you save or "commit" your changes you, or someone else can go back to that change.

By creating a commit you are in essence creating a checkpoint that you can go back to in the future.
