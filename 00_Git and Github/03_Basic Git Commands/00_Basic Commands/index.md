### Giting Started with Command line

A few terminal commands we will want to remember:
* `cd foldername` this moves you to the folder or file you specify through the terminal.
* `cd ..` this moves you back to previous folder
* `ls` Lists all items in that folder
* `ls -a` Lists all items in a folder and hidden items
* `:wq` When in **vim** or doing a merge request, this well write and save your changes


### First Steps Setup

* `git config --global user.email "name@email.com"`
