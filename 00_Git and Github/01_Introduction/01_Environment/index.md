### Environment Set-up

To make sure our computer is set up properly, we need to make sure we have properly installed everything we will need to get started.

#### Please set-up the following:

* [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Create a Github Account](https://github.com/join)
* Install a text editor like [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/)   

Note: You can check to see if you already have Git installed to your computer `git` into your command line. If it returns a list of commands you are good to go.

To check your Git version you can type the following command into your terminal `git --version`
