### Git Basics

It is impertinent that version control exists locally on your machine. This means that without internet connection, it is still possible to use Git to create checkpoints that you can come back to in the future.

THIS IS ALL ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE AND JUST SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE A FASTER, MORE ELEGANT WORKFLOW.

### Example WORKFLOW

* Initialize the repository on your local machine
* Add files that have changed
* Commit the changes made (creating a checkpoint)
* Push the committed changes

To easily set up just that workflow, open your terminal and enter the following commands:

```
git init
git add 'Enter file names or folders that have changed'
git commit -m 'enter a message reminder here'
```

This process will allow you to keep track of the changes that you are making in your file folders. It is important to commit often as the more commits created = more ability to return to previous work.
